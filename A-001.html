<p><strong>Object ID:</strong> A-001</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Object A-001 is a metallic cube, approximately 15 cm on each side, with a dull, non-reflective surface. It continuously emits faint, inaudible whispers that only become perceptible when an individual is within a 5-meter radius. These whispers manifest as auditory hallucinations in various ancient languages (e.g., Sumerian, Old Norse, Proto-Indo-European), irrespective of the listener's linguistic knowledge. Prolonged exposure (over 30 minutes) can lead to severe cognitive dissonance, mild paranoia, and a distorted perception of reality, where inanimate objects may appear to subtly shift or whisper.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Protocols:</strong> Object A-001 is to be housed within a lead-lined Faraday cage located in Containment Chamber B-7. The chamber must be equipped with sound dampeners to prevent any potential sonic anomalies, although none have been observed. Access to Chamber B-7 requires Level 3 security clearance and G-Code Delta-7 authorization. Personnel are advised to wear noise-canceling headphones during transfer or observation to mitigate potential psychological effects. Bi-weekly psychiatric evaluations are mandatory for all personnel assigned to A-001.</p>
